# Fun with Linear Algebra

by Anne Ensign

## About

This repo is for me to play with some concepts I've been learning with Machine Learning, specifically matrices.

## Running the Programs

Unless otherwise stated, all that's needed to run the files will be Python. 

In your CLI, cd to the project folder you'd like to run and enter `python [FILE.py]`, replacing FILE with the name of the file.
