# Fun with Linear Algebra

by Anne Ensign

## About

This repo is for me to play with some concepts I've been learning with Machine Learning, specifically matrices.

I'd like to credit Dr. Andrew Ng's course, [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning), from Standford University taught through Coursera. As I learn the material from his course, I have been seeking ways to impliment the lessons through Python, Scikit-Learn and Matplotlib, which is why I created this repo. 

## Running the Programs

Unless otherwise stated, all that's needed to run the files will be Python. 

In your CLI, cd to the project folder you'd like to run and enter `python [FILE.py]`, replacing FILE with the name of the file.
